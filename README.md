# NeuroMuscular-Monitoring

NeuroMuscular Monitoring is a critical aspect of medical practice, particularly in the field of anesthesia, where precise assessment of neuromuscular blockade depth is essential to ensure patient safety during surgical procedures. This project proposes the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for the real-time prediction of neuromuscular blockade depth based on electromyographic (EMG) signals. The ANN model is designed to learn complex patterns and relationships within the EMG data, enabling accurate estimation of the depth of neuromuscular blockade.

The dataset utilized for training and validation includes a diverse range of neuromuscular blockade scenarios, encompassing various drugs and patient characteristics. The proposed ANN architecture incorporates multiple layers with appropriate activation functions and regularization techniques to enhance the model's ability to generalize across different patient populations and drug regimens. The network is trained using a robust optimization algorithm, ensuring efficient convergence and reliable performance.

The developed ANN demonstrates promising results in predicting neuromuscular blockade depth during anesthesia, achieving high accuracy and reliability in comparison to traditional monitoring methods. The model's real-time capabilities make it suitable for integration into existing monitoring systems, providing clinicians with a valuable tool for optimizing drug dosages and enhancing patient outcomes. This research contributes to the advancement of NeuroMuscular Monitoring techniques, leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to improve the precision and efficiency of depth-level assessments during medical procedures.
